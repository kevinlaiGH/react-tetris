# react-tetris

I really enjoy playing tetris when I was a kid, so I have decided to create a MVP version of Tetris from scratch, it is a challenge for myself to test my understanding of React and how to utilize custom react hooks. Watch out for this space, it's gonna be exciting!

Todos:

- [ ] Create a 10 by 20 grid that we wee each cell that going to be gray out initially
- [ ] When we place blocks, each cell will change from gray to other colors
- [ ] Manage game state with custom react hooks for tetris and tetris board
- [ ] Implement keyboard controls for game
- [ ] Create state for storing score
- [ ] Detect when the game is over
- [ ] Show upcoming blocks
- [ ] Keep score and delete lines whenever they are completed filled
      - add state for a score
